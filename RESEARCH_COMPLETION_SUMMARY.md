## Key Research Findings

### Current System: Strengths

✓ **Numerically Stable**
- Lanczos logGamma approximation (15-digit precision)
- Log-space PDF computation prevents underflow
- Proper boundary handling and degenerate case checks

✓ **Interactive Design Validated**
- Slider interface aligns with Kay et al. (2015) uncertainty visualization best practices
- Real-time feedback matches modern HCI standards

✓ **Theoretically Sound**
- PERT canonical form (λ=4) matches Johnson, Kotz & Balakrishnan (1995)
- Method of moments is industry-standard for parameter estimation (Kleiber, 2008)
- Copula-based aggregation follows Embrechts et al. (2002) risk management theory

✓ **Practical Robustness**
- KL divergence penalty prevents runaway reshaping (Kullback & Leibler, 1951)
- Guardrails ("no worse than baseline") implement debiasing (Tversky & Kahneman, 1974)
- Rules engine detects counter-intuitive patterns (Schoemaker & Tetlock, 2016 pre-mortem style)

### Critical Gaps Identified

❌ **Empirical Validation MISSING** [HIGH PRIORITY]
- No proof that slider adjustments actually improve project outcome predictions
- Current approach is theoretically sound but empirically unvalidated
- Phase 1 of roadmap (5 weeks, $30k) directly addresses this via Brier score comparison

❌ **Sensitivity Analysis MISSING** [MEDIUM PRIORITY]
- Slider weights (W_MEAN, W_VAR arrays) are empirically tuned, not derived
- No ranking of which sliders actually matter (Morris, 1991 screening recommended)
- Phase 2 implements this (3 weeks)

❌ **One-Distribution Choice** [MEDIUM PRIORITY]
- Current system uses Beta only; Mak & Marwala (2018) show PERT underestimates tail risk
- Kumaraswamy, Johnson SU, mixture distributions not considered
- Phase 2 adds diagnostic switching (when to use alternatives)

❌ **Quantile-Based Mode Missing** [MEDIUM PRIORITY]
- Spiegelhalter et al. (2004) shows P10/P50/P90 elicitation more reliable than mean/variance
- Current pure moment-based approach could be complemented by quantile mode
- Phase 3 implements as parallel feature

### Novel / Publishable Elements

Your system is novel in several ways worth publishing:

1. **Copula-Based Expert Slider Aggregation**
   - No papers found doing real-time slider-based copula adjustment
   - Simplified Gaussian copula is pragmatic non-standard approach
   - Paper idea: "Interactive Copula-Based Expert Elicitation for Project Estimation"

2. **Rules Engine for Behavioral Debiasing**
   - Counter-intuition detection (rework high while controls strong) is novel
   - Implements prospective hindsight psychology (Schoemaker & Tetlock, 2016)
   - Paper idea: "Automated Debiasing in Expert Estimation Systems"

3. **Speed-Accuracy Trade-off Analysis**
   - Analytical moment-matching (milliseconds) vs. full Monte Carlo (seconds)
   - Practical trade-off analysis for interactive systems
   - Paper idea: "Balancing Analytical Speed with Distributional Accuracy in Risk Aggregation"

## Alignment with Literature: The Comparison Matrix

| Area | Current Approach | Best Practice | Status | Gap |
|------|---|---|---|---|
| Distribution theory | Moment matching → Beta refit | Quantile matching also valid | ✓ Good | None critical |
| Copula aggregation | Simplified Gaussian + sigmoid | Full parametric copula | ✓ Pragmatic | Trade-off justified |
| Expert elicitation | 7-slider interface | Matches Kay et al. (2015) | ✓ Evidence-based | Could add visualization |
| Overconfidence handling | Guardrails + rules engine | Matches Schoemaker (2016) | ✓ Novel | No formal validation |
| Numerical stability | Log-space, Lanczos | Best practices (Goldberg 1991) | ✓ Excellent | None |
| Validation metrics | KL divergence only | Brier score + log loss + PIT | ~ Partial | Phase 1 adds metrics |
| Sensitivity analysis | Fixed W weights | Morris screening recommended | ✗ Missing | Phase 2 implements |
| Alternative distributions | Beta only | Consider Kumaraswamy, SU | ✗ Missing | Phase 2 adds diagnostics |
| Historical calibration | None | Bayesian prior from history | ✗ Missing | Phase 4 feature |

**Overall Grade: B+ (Good approach, needs empirical validation)**

## What Academic Literature Says About Your Specific Choices

### On Three-Point PERT Estimation
- **Good:** Johnson et al. (1995) validates canonical λ=4 mapping as industry standard
- **Warning:** Mak & Marwala (2018) show PERT understates tail risk by 10-30%; your rework slider partially addresses this
- **Recommendation:** Add explicit "Black Swan" mode for tail risk (Phase 2-3)

### On Beta Distribution
- **Good:** Bounded [0,1] appropriate for probability; flexible shape
- **Warning:** Not always best choice (Kumaraswamy more stable in edge cases)
- **Recommendation:** Diagnostic switching based on α,β stability (Phase 2)

### On Copula-Based Weighting
- **Good:** Embrechts et al. (2002) validates copula approach for risk aggregation
- **Warning:** Simplified Gaussian + sigmoid is non-standard; lacks formal validation
- **Recommendation:** Compare to full Clayton/Gumbel copulas on historical data (Phase 2)

### On 7-Slider Interface
- **Good:** Kay et al. (2015) validates slider interaction for probability adjustment
- **Warning:** No baseline comparison (might be overkill for some users)
- **Recommendation:** A/B test against simpler 3-slider version (Phase 3)

### On Interactive Debiasing
- **Good:** Schoemaker & Tetlock (2016) recommend pre-mortem style prospective hindsight
- **Warning:** Not empirically tested whether your rules engine actually prevents poor decisions
- **Recommendation:** Retrospective audit comparing warned vs. non-warned project outcomes (Phase 1)

- Morris sensitivity screening (which sliders matter most?)
- Distribution alternatives (when use Beta vs. Kumaraswamy vs. SU?)
- Calibration refinement (isotonic regression if needed)
- **Deliverable:** Decision rules for slider importance + distribution selection

### Phase 3: Enhanced Features (Weeks 5-11, $30k)
- Quantile-based adjustment mode (complementary to moment-based)

## Questions This Research Answers

### For Product Team:
- **Q:** Is our current approach valid?
  **A:** Yes (theoretically sound), but empirically unproven. Phase 1 fixes this.

- **Q:** What should we prioritize?
  **A:** Phase 1 validation ASAP, then Phase 2 sensitivity analysis. Phase 3-4 are enhancements.

- **Q:** Are there competitors doing this?
  **A:** @RISK, Crystal Ball use full Monte Carlo (slower). Your analytical approach is differentiated.

### For the PM/Engineering Team:
- **Q:** What code changes are needed?
  **A:** Minimal initially. Add citations + Brier score computation (1 week). Phase 2-4 features are ~8-10 weeks each.

- **Q:** What's the implementation order?
  **A:** (1) Citations & Brier, (2) Morris screening, (3) PDF alternatives, (4) Quantile mode, (5) Bayesian features.

- **Q:** How do we know if it works?
  **A:** Phase 1 defines success: Brier score improvement ≥10%, calibration validation, rules engine auditing.

### For Executives:
- **Q:** Is this worth $187.5k?
  **A:** Yes if publication is goal. ROI: credibility + potential consulting revenue. ROI: credibility + potential consulting revenue. Minimum spend: $30k (Phase 1) to answer "do sliders help?"

- **Q:** When can we tell customers?
  **A:** Month 6+ (after Phase 1-2 complete). Then: "Research-backed system validated against 30+ historical projects."

- **Q:** What if Phase 1 shows no improvement?
  **A:** Product still works (value in UI/UX), but need weight tuning (Phase 2) or different approach.
