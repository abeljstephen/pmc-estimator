2. docs/research/pmbok/WEIGHT_VALIDATION_SUMMARY.md - Weight justification
3. docs/architecture/MATH_AUDIT_REPORT.md - Math verification
**Result**: Understand what the system does and is validated

### Complete Academic Understanding (4-6 hours)
1. All architecture/ documents (3-4 hrs)
2. All research/ documents (3-4 hrs)
3. validation/VALIDATION_ROADMAP_IMPLEMENTATION.md (1 hr)
**Result**: Ready to present, defend, or extend system

### Publication Preparation (8+ hours)
1. Everything above (6-8 hrs)
2. references/REFERENCES_ANNOTATED_BIBLIOGRAPHY.md (2 hrs)
3. Make detailed notes for writing
**Result**: Ready to write academic paper
