## Validation Strategy Overview

The PMC Estimator validation follows a **4-phase roadmap**:

### Phase 1: Foundation (Weeks 1-5, $30k)
- Collect 30+ historical projects
- Compute baseline Brier scores
- Establish measurement methodology
- Decision gate: Does system improve forecast accuracy?

### Phase 2: Analysis (Weeks 3-10, $45k)
- Sensitivity analysis (Morris screening)
- Identify which weights actually contribute
- Test across different project types
- Decision gate: Which factors matter most?

### Phase 3: Features (Weeks 5-11, $62.5k)
- Test alternative distributions
- Develop domain-specific calibrations
- Implement advanced features
- Decision gate: Are improvements significant?

### Phase 4: Publication (Weeks 8-21, $50k)
- Write academic paper
- Prepare for peer review
- Disseminate findings
- Decision gate: Is publication successful?

**Total Investment**: $187.5k over 21 weeks

## Key Concepts from Validation Research

### Brier Score (Primary Metric)
- Range: 0 (perfect) to 2 (worst possible)
- Formula: BS = (1/N) × Σ(forecast - outcome)²
- Interpretation: Smaller is better, "better than 50/50" means BS < 0.25
- Target: Reduce BS by 20%+ from baseline

### Calibration
- Definition: Do predicted probabilities match actual frequencies?
- Example: Of 100 events predicted at 70%, do ~70 actually occur?
- Measurement: Calibration curve (predicted vs. actual)
- Goal: Points fall on diagonal (y=x)

### Proper Scoring Rules
- Property: Incentivizes honest probability estimates
- Types: Brier score, log loss, ranked probability score
- Why matter: Prevent overconfidence and underconfidence
- Usage: Evaluate forecast quality objectively

## Key Questions Answered

**Q: How do I know if the system actually works?**
A: Test against historical project data using Brier score. See VALIDATION_ROADMAP_IMPLEMENTATION.md Phase 1.

**Q: What sample size do I need?**
A: Minimum 30 historical projects for Phase 1. More is better. See Phase 1 section.

**Q: How long does validation take?**
A: Phase 1 is 5 weeks. Full 4-phase validation is ~5-6 months. See phase timeline.

**Q: What's the right metric for accuracy?**
A: Brier score is primary, but also use calibration curves and log loss. See PROPER_SCORING_RULES.md (when available).

**Q: How do I improve calibration?**
A: Phase 2 sensitivity analysis identifies problem areas. Phase 3 tests improvements. See CALIBRATION_METHODS.md (when available).

**Q: What if Phase 1 shows negative results?**
A: Return to weight calibration or consider distribution alternatives. Detailed in Phase 1 decision gates section.
