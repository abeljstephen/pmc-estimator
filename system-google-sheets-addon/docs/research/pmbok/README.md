## Weight System Overview

The PMC Estimator uses **7 weighted sliders** to capture project complexity:

```
W = [0.20, 0.20, 0.18, 0.15, 0.10, 0.09, 0.08]
    ↓     ↓     ↓     ↓     ↓     ↓     ↓
   Budget Schedule Scope  Scope  Rework Risk  User
  Flexibility Flexibility Certainty Reduction %  Tolerance Confidence
   (20%)   (20%)   (18%)   (15%)   (10%)   (9%)   (8%)
```

These sum to 1.0 and represent the **relative importance** of each factor in determining estimation accuracy.

## PMBOK Justification

Each weight is grounded in PMBOK guidance:

| Weight | PMBOK Source | Rationale | Buffer Range |
|--------|---|----------|----------|
| 0.20 (Budget) | Ch. 7, 11 | Cost buffer, reserve analysis | 15-25% |
| 0.20 (Schedule) | Ch. 6, 11 | Schedule buffer, time contingencies | 15-25% |
| 0.18 (Scope) | Ch. 5 | Scope certainty, requirements stability | 12-20% |
| 0.15 (Reduction) | Ch. 5, 7 | Rework potential, contingency reduction | 10-18% |
| 0.10 (Rework) | Ch. 8, 11 | Quality/rework percentage | 5-15% |
| 0.09 (Risk) | Ch. 11 | Risk tolerance, risk response planning | 5-12% |
| 0.08 (User) | Ch. 5, 13 | Stakeholder confidence, engagement | 5-10% |

1. This README (5 min)
2. WEIGHT_VALIDATION_SUMMARY.md (40 min)
3. ALTERNATIVE_WEIGHT_FRAMEWORKS.md (45 min)
→ You'll know: *PMBOK is one framework among many; weights are hypotheses, not proven facts*

### Complete Understanding (2.5-3 hours)
1. This README (5 min)
2. WEIGHT_VALIDATION_SUMMARY.md (45 min)
3. PMBOK_BUFFER_ANALYSIS.md (1-1.5 hours)
4. PMBOK_FORMULA_REFERENCE.md (30 min)

### Data-Driven Path (Recommended now)
1. WEIGHT_VALIDATION_SUMMARY.md - Quick PMBOK overview (40 min)
2. ALTERNATIVE_WEIGHT_FRAMEWORKS.md - Why theory alone isn't enough (45 min)
3. Go to: `../../validation/VALIDATION_ROADMAP_IMPLEMENTATION.md` - Plan Phase 1 to determine ACTUAL optimal weights

→ Decision: Approve Phase 1 validation to determine true weights?

## Key Questions Answered

**Q: Are these weights arbitrary?**
A: Not entirely. They're informed by PMBOK guidance and industry patterns. BUT they're not uniquely justified by any single framework. See ALTERNATIVE_WEIGHT_FRAMEWORKS.md for why multiple frameworks suggest different weight distributions.

**Q: Why these specific percentages (20%, 20%, 18%, etc.)?**
A: PMBOK provides buffer ranges (15-30%), and we selected values in the middle-to-conservative ranges. Other frameworks (software, construction, finance) suggest different distributions. See Part 4 of ALTERNATIVE_WEIGHT_FRAMEWORKS.md for cross-framework comparison.

**Q: Can weights be adjusted?**
A: Yes. But better approach: Use Phase 1 empirical data to determine OPTIMAL weights. See validation/VALIDATION_ROADMAP_IMPLEMENTATION.md.

**Q: What if our context is different from PMBOK?**
A: Excellent question. Different industries (software = COCOMO, construction, pharma) show different optimal weights. Phase 1 will discover YOUR optimal weights using YOUR project data.
